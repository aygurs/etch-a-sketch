A web application version of the popular game 'Etch-A-Sketch', made with JS, HTML and CSS.

# How to use
First, you have the option to choose your grid size. You can either use the buttons to choose a provided grid size, or use the text box below it to input a custom grid size. You can't choose a number higher than 100!

Then, you can choose your colour on the left hand side. Either black, white (for the colour white, or use as an eraser), or you can choose a custom colour with the colour picker. You can also let fate decide and click the 'random colour' button to see what colour you get!

To draw, simply hover your mouse on the canvas!

# Future updates
Updates I would like to push in the future:
- Click to draw (for mobile)
- Save your canvas
- Share your canvas

# Why I built this project
This was one of my earlier projects using the DOM and JS. It was my first experience using JS to manipulate the DOM. It was good experience for JS logic to be able to drawe and change the colours of the squares of the grid. I built it for my own enjoyment and to test my skills also using new methods, like the colour picker and making grids!
